## Introduction

* Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light (UV) and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. When inhaled, ozone can damage the lungs. 

* It might be useful if we can predict ozone level from some ordinary measurements like temperature and wind speed. 

* This app presents a function for ozone level prediction based on an existing data set from the ElemStatLearn R package Version 2015.6.26.

## Prediction Model

* About Ozone data set  
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
load("ozone.RData")
head(ozone, 2)
```


* A simple linear regression model is used for prediction by either temperature or wind speed.
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
 mod1 <- lm(ozone ~ wind, data = ozone)
 mod2 <- lm(ozone ~ temperature, data = ozone)
```
Predicted by Wind (Tab 1)

Ozone level = `r round(mod1$coefficients[1],2)` + `r round(mod1$coefficients[2],2)` * Wind

Ozone ~ Temperature (Tab 2)    

Ozone level = `r round(mod2$coefficients[1],2)` + `r round(mod2$coefficients[2],2)` * Temperature

## Sample plot for Ozone ~ Temperature

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)

plot_ly(x = ~temperature, y = ~ozone, data = ozone, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", size = 2) %>%
        add_trace(x = ~temperature, y = ~predict(mod2), mode = "lines", line = list(color = 'rgb(22, 96,    
                  167)', width = 4)) %>% layout(showlegend = F, title = "Ozone Level by Temperature")

```
